# Holiday Manager 
Introduction
------------
The Holiday Manager program utilizes a user-friendly interface to create holidays and store all relevant information including name, date, and associated weather. This program scrapes holiday data and queries an API to obtain weather information. The user can add, remove, and view holidays in any given week, which can then be saved to a json file containing any changes made.

To access the preloaded holidays, see [Holiday Information](https://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/us/2022)

To access weather data, see [Weather Information](https://openweathermap.org/api)
